# Roman-4th-birthday

I wanted to surprise my son with a website at his 4th birthday party. He loves trains and gets a kick out of seeing photos of himself as a baby so I alod made a YouTube video which is embedded on the page. Roman loves trains so I made a moving train CSS animation and got the train to blow smoke. I also added fireworks to the page.
